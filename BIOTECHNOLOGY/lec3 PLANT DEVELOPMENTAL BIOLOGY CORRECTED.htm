  Welcometo the second lecture of Characteristic of Plant Growth and
  Development. So, ifwe recall in the first lecture, we had discussed the
  primary growth anddevelopment, secondary growth and development and lastly the
  ,lateral growthand development. We had also discussed about the axis where
  ,the growth anddevelopment occurs, the points or the region of the plants
  where themeristematic activities are positioned and how they are maintained
  andcoordinated during the process of plant growth and development.

  Nowwe will continue this lecture of characteristic of plant growth and
  developmentwith another characteristic of plant development which is
  Plasticity. It isextremely important for the plants; considering the fact that
  plants aresessile in nature. They cannot move from one place to another place
  which meansthat they have to face all the environmental disturbance or all
  theenvironmental conditions just by standing at one place. And, to cope with
  thischange in the environment, they have adopted a very nice mechanism which
  is a plasticin nature.

  Thusthe plasticity is basically an adaptability to prevailing environmental
  condition.I will take couple of examples for it and you will appreciate that
  howdevelopmental plasticity is adopted or it is acquired by the plants.

  Ifyou take this example, this is couch grass. Basically, it,s shoot grows
  belowthe ground as well as above the ground. And, what happens when the shoots
  are growingunderground. Underground means it has a very different
  environmental conditionthan the above ground. In underground, the light
  intensity is less. Oxygenavailability and other factors are very different
  than the above ground.

    text-align: justify;
    line-height: 150%;

  Youcan see that when the shoot is growing underground, it has a developmental
  programwhich is giving rise to long internode and leaf like structure which is
  calledscale leaf and more importantly every node you can see a lot of
  adventitious rootdevelopment.

  So,there is a developmental growth which is already going on here. ,But once
  thisgrowing shoot reaches the ground and once it is coming outside the ground,
  itswitches its developmental program. There is a change. ,The first thing that
  happensis now it would start making short internode.

    line-height: 150%;
  "

  So,the internode length is reduced to do that it has to change. It is the
  basicprogram of developmental biology. Another thing which happens there, is
  aformation of true leaf blade like structure. This shoot at the node is
  nolonger making the roots. So, what are the changes it has to do
  developmentally?

  "

  Ithas changed its program for making long internode to the short internode.
  Ithas major changes in their program of the leaf development. Now, the leaf
  isdifferent and more when it was underground it was having active
  developmentalprogram for adventitious root development. But once it is coming
  above ground, ithas to shut down the program of adventitious root development.
