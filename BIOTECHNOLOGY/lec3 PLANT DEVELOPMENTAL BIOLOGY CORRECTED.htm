to the second lecture of Characteristic of Plant Growth and Development. So, if
we recall in the first lecture, we had discussed the primary growth and
development, secondary growth and development and lastly the  lateral growth
and development. We had also discussed about the axis where  the growth and
development occurs, the points or the region of the plants where the
meristematic activities are positioned and how they are maintained and
coordinated during the process of plant growth and development. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now
we will continue this lecture of characteristic of plant growth and development
with another characteristic of plant development which is Plasticity. It is
extremely important for the plants; considering the fact that plants are
sessile in nature. They cannot move from one place to another place which means
that they have to face all the environmental disturbance or all the
environmental conditions just by standing at one place. And, to cope with this
change in the environment, they have adopted a very nice mechanism which is a plastic
in nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Thus
the plasticity is basically an adaptability to prevailing environmental condition.
I will take couple of examples for it and you will appreciate that how
developmental plasticity is adopted or it is acquired by the plants. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
you take this example, this is couch grass. Basically, it’s shoot grows below
the ground as well as above the ground. And, what happens when the shoots are growing
underground. Underground means it has a very different environmental condition
than the above ground. In underground, the light intensity is less. Oxygen
availability and other factors are very different than the above ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You
can see that when the shoot is growing underground, it has a developmental program
which is giving rise to long internode and leaf like structure which is called
scale leaf and more importantly every node you can see a lot of adventitious root
development. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
there is a developmental growth which is already going on here.  But once this
growing shoot reaches the ground and once it is coming outside the ground, it
switches its developmental program. There is a change.  The first thing that happens
is now it would start making short internode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So,
the internode length is reduced to do that it has to change. It is the basic
program of developmental biology. Another thing which happens there, is a
formation of true leaf blade like structure. This shoot at the node is no
longer making the roots. So, what are the changes it has to do developmentally?
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
has changed its program for making long internode to the short internode. It
has major changes in their program of the leaf development. Now, the leaf is
different and more when it was underground it was having active developmental
program for adventitious root development. But once it is coming above ground, it
has to shut down the program of adventitious root development.</span></p>
