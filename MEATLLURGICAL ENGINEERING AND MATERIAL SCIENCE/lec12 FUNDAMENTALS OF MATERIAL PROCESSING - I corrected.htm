	problem of superheat. Like I said earlier in the previous class that, for simplification
	purpose, we were assuming that temperature of the liquid or the liquid metal that
	you pour in is always at melting point; but that is not the case. There will always
	be some amount of or you want it to be a little higher than the melting point, because
	then the fluidity increases. If you are very close to the melting point, the fluidity
	is very poor. So now, how will the things change? We have always talked about the
	temperature profile with respect to assuming that the liquid temperature is constant.

	font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So if somewhere say the temperature was like
	this, and solid was like this, or it was something like this, in the two condition;
	this is the insulating mold, and later on we will see other conditions. These are�
	two different conditions, but what was common in all these was that, solid will
	of course never go beyond <span style='color:red'>T<sub>M</sub></span>, but the
	liquid is usually higher than <span style='color:red'>T<sub>M</sub></span>. But
	then how much higher that is the question. The answer is it is usually of the order
	of 50 to 100 <sup><span style='color:red'>o</span></sup><span style='color:
	red'>C.</span> </span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
	line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
	font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now if we look at the temperature in Kelvin
	that is less than 10<span style='color:red'> %</span> in terms of absolute temperature,
	the temperature delta T is approximately 10 <span style='color:red'>%</span> �less
	than 10 <span style='color:red'>%</span> actually. So the temperature that we are
	talking about, the increase in the temperature, the liquid is not a very large quantity
	to look at the temperature profile, or to change the temperature profile by a much
	different value. But what will be different is that because there is a temperature
	rise, or the temperature is higher, and the liquid quantity may be very high; so,
	because of the specific heat of the material, when the liquid cools down, there
	will also be some amount of heat being generated or being given out because of that.</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
	line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
	font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So what is that amount of heat? So that will
	be equal to, since we are talking about liquid, so <span style='color:red'>C<sub>L</sub>&#8710;T</span>.
	Now this amount of heat is additional, and wherever we have used the term wherever
	we have talked in terms of heat energy, over there, we can make corrections by adding
	this term, because this is the only thing that is changing in a major way, otherwise,
	you see that the total temperature drop is less than 10 <span style='color:
	red'>%</span>; but even that 10 <span style='color:red'>%</span> temperature drop
	can lead to very large amount of change in the heat energy.</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
	line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
	font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So what we usually do is, what was the place
	that we actually looked at the heat, or the total amount of energy, and that was
	heat of fusion H. So this heat of fusion H can now be changed to <span
	style='color:red'>H + C<sub>L</sub>&#8710;T</span>. Now, once wherever we had that
	those values, if we replace those values by <br clear=all>
	<span style='color:red'>H + C<sub>L</sub>&#8710;T</span>, we will be able to take
	into account the effect of superheat. Since �the liquid is at higher temperature,
	it will only change the total amount of heat and because of that, �the solidification
	rate may be a little different and time required for total solidification may be
	a little different. And remember, �the temperature profile equation does not have
	the H value, which means it will not get changed.</span></p>
